The work involves improvements to the trip generation model, mode split models, external trip models, and the trip assignment model. The consultants under contract to SCAG, Cambridge Systematics and Urban Analytics, presented proposed work plans for each of the travel demand components, including auto availability and trip generation models, external trip models, mode choice models, and trip assignment models and solicited comments on the validity of the proposed work from the peer review panel.")]),e._v(" "),o("h4",{attrs:{id:"publication-date"}},[o("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#publication-date"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Publication Date")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("2003-3-11")]),e._v(" "),o("hr")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
