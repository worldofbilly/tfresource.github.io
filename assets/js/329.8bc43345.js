Travel time on each link is represented in Y axis. Travel time on Link 1 is dependent on the link traffic volume shown on bottom X axis. Travel time on Link 2 is dependent on link traffic volume shown on top X axis. Note that the top X axis numbers are in reverse order so the sum of the two volumes will always equal 3,000. The point where these two travel time curves meet is the user equilibrium condition, where travel time on both links is equal (i.e. 1.333 minutes represented by green line). At this UE point, the traffic volume on link 1 is 2686 and traffic volume on link 2 is 314. Any other allocation of traffic between these two links results in unequal travel time and violates above mentioned Wardrop’s criteria. It is also important to note that, at this UE condition, the estimated traffic on link 1 is higher that assumed link capacity. This is one of the weaknesses frequently brought up in many transportation planning studies. Therefore, the estimated traffic volume and travel time are also interpreted as magnitude of total demand and the extent of congestion in model application scenarios. Assignment models that relates to link capacities are available but are not as widely used in practice.\\")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("'''Figure 2: An Example of User Equilibrium Condition '''\n![Figure 2: An Example of User Equilibrium Condition ](UE Condition.jpg \"fig:Figure 2: An Example of User Equilibrium Condition \")\\")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The dotted lines in Figure 2 show an example of conditions when the UE criterion is not met.
