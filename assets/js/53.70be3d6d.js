There are unique implementations, such as the Shirley Highway (Virginia) lanes leading into Washington DC and the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, both of which generate so-called “slugs,” or casual carpools, of unrelated individuals. There are cities that have systems of HOV lanes of significant length (10 to 20 miles), such as Houston or Seattle, which generate some carpools of unrelated individuals. There are also many implementations of short 5- to 10-mile HOV lanes, not part of a system, which have most of the users drawn from household-based shared rides. We can think of this last group as opportunistic HOV lane users. We attempt in this study to disentangle the somewhat scant information on user behavior (which can only be studied by a disaggregate analysis of user/non-user surveys) to determine predictors of HOV use. We also describe briefly why the truly unique systems work the way they do and why those experiences cannot be generalized to be useful for applications elsewhere.")]),e._v(" "),t("h4",{attrs:{id:"copyright-usage-permissions"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#copyright-usage-permissions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Copyright & Usage Permissions")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("NCHRP")]),e._v(" "),t("h4",{attrs:{id:"publication-date"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#publication-date"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Publication Date")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("2006|October}}")]),e._v(" "),t("hr")])}),[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=r.exports}}]);
